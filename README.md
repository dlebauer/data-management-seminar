# Graduate Seminar ABE 598 “Data Lifecycle” 

The goal of this course will be to train graduate students in the data lifecycle from collection to analysis. The seminar course will include weekly lectures.

One hour per week of lecture

Topics will include:

* What data are already available?
* Data shapes and structures (tables, relational & nosql databases, raster)
* Quality assurance and Data cleaning
* Data description
* Metadata and Data standards
* Publishing data: repositories and versions
* Exploratory data analysis
* Reproducible Research

The course could be extended in two ways:
 * one hour / week of lab so that students can learn hands on 
 * group projects that allow students to explore problems related to their own field of interest through the lens of curating a dataset. Prior to beginning the course, students will identify a small dataset that they will curate over the course of the semester.
