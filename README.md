# Graduate Seminar ABE 598 “Data Lifecycle” 


## Objective 

The goal of this course will be to train graduate students in the data lifecycle from collection to analysis. The seminar course will include weekly lectures.



## Topics

* What data are already available?
* Data shapes and structures (tables, relational & nosql databases, raster)
* Quality assurance and Data cleaning
* Data description
* Metadata and Data standards
* Publishing data: repositories and versions
* Exploratory data analysis
* Reproducible Research

## time

One hour per week of lecture

The course could be extended in two ways:
 * one hour / week of lab so that students can learn hands on 
 * group projects that allow students to explore problems related to their own field of interest through the lens of curating a dataset. Prior to beginning the course, students will identify a small dataset that they will curate over the course of the semester.
